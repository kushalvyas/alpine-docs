# Contributing to Alpine

Alpine is work in progress and is currently being maintained on [GitHub](https://github.com/kushalvyas/alpine). 

We appreciate any constructive community feedback and support. We invite all the researchers across all disciplines to explore, and suggest any features you find particularly useful, report bugs, and open pull-requests to extend alpine to areas of scientific computing.  

Feel free to reach out to Kushal([kvyas@rice.edu](mailto:kvyas@rice.edu)) or Guha([guha@rice.edu](mailto:guha@rice.edu)) if you want to explore or extend Alpine for any particular applications.
